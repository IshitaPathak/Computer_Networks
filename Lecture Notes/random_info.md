# Frequently Asked Questions (People Also Ask from Google)

## What are the six types of topology?
In a computer network, there are mainly six types of physical topology, they are:
•	Bus Topology.
•	Ring Topology.
•	Star Topology.
•	Mesh Topology.
•	Tree Topology.
•	Hybrid Topology.

## Is bus topology secure?
In a bus topology, any computer connected to a network can see all the data transmissions on all the other computers. So there are no chances of security. In a star topology, security depends on the central device.

## Why is bus topology best?
Advantages of Bus Topology :

It works very efficiently well when there is a small network. The length of cable required is less than a star topology, and it is easy to connect or remove devices in this network without affecting any other device. Very cost-effective as compared to other network topologies, i.e., mesh and star.

## What is the cheapest topology?
Bus topology
Bus topology is the easiest and cheapest type of topology to install. With a one-to-one ratio of devices to drop lines, this topology requires less cable than other topologies, reducing the installation time and expenses. Adding new devices to the network is also straightforward.
